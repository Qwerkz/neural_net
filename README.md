# neural_net
This repository is a sample of the work I performed as a doctoral candidate. 

The "models" directory contains pieces of code pulled from a larger codebase to illustrate the type of modeling performed. One 
is from a model used in XPPAut. The other is a MATLAB script.

The "simulations" directory are all actual simulations performed against this codebase. They are meant to illustrate the 
various aspects of neural dynamics which were illuminated by the models expressed in the codebase. 

The "xpp" directory is simply a reference for the reader. Many of these simulations were performed on propriety software created
by the principal investigator of this project. I included a directory here to give an idea of the types of information and processes
that were provided by this software.
